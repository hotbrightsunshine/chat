Everyone can contribute to this project and modify it however they like. 
Yet, use cases are well defined in our documentation, and we please you to follow them. 
With that, changes that do respect use cases instead, will be prioritized. 
If you would like to add a new feature not described in use cases anyway, 
please consider creating an issue for that or forking and then applying a pull request.
